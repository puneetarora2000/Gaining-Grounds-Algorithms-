#Gaining Ground Algorithms refer to a collection of computational models designed to identify stocks,etf etc  exhibiting upward trends in their price or valuation. 
These algorithms are the cornerstone of a quantitative investment strategy aimed at constructing a dynamic portfolio.

Core Components

Algorithm Repository: A centralized collection of various algorithms, each with its own unique methodology to identify stocks on the rise. This repository acts as a toolkit for investment managers.
Stock Identification: Algorithms within the repository analyze vast datasets of historical stock prices, trading volumes, financial ratios, and other relevant market data to pinpoint stocks demonstrating positive momentum.
Rebalancing Periods: The portfolio is periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the underlying stock universe. This dynamic approach ensures that the portfolio remains aligned with the investment strategy.
Portfolio Construction: The selected stocks are combined into a single portfolio, aiming for diversification and optimal performance. The concept of a "constellation" suggests that the stocks should complement each other, working synergistically to generate returns.
Potential Algorithms and Factors

The algorithm repository include many indicators based algorithms but not limited to these :

Momentum Indicators: Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), Rate of Change (ROC)
Trend-Following Indicators: Simple Moving Average (SMA), Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
Breakout Strategies: Identifying stocks breaking out of resistance levels
Volume-Based Indicators: On-Balance Volume (OBV), Accumulation/Distribution Indicator
Fundamental Analysis Integration: Incorporating financial ratios, earnings growth, and other fundamental metrics
